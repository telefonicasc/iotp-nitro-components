# Components review

## angular_directives

This is not a component actually. This creates 2 directives for angularjs 
integration.
### nitroComponent directive
This directive allows you to attach a component to a dom element.

### nitroValue directive
This allows you to bind nitro components data-binding components to angular
scope

## application_boxmessage
This is not a component.

## application_menu
Is the main menu of the application used in Kermit. It has its own tooltip
implemented inside. Does it worth it to create a tooltip component? That
can be reused for these things?
